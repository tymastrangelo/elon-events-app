# 📅 Elon Events App

A modern, mobile-first events discovery and club engagement platform built for the Elon University community. Designed to complement existing tools like PhoenixCONNECT by enhancing visibility, usability, and student participation.

---

## 🚀 Why This App?

While PhoenixCONNECT serves as the university’s official hub for clubs and events, many students report difficulty navigating it and low engagement due to its outdated interface. The Events App bridges that gap with a modern design and seamless UX.

## 💡 Inspiration

Created to **increase student involvement**, provide **instant access to events**, and give **clubs an easy platform to grow**. This project exists because no platform — including PhoenixCONNECT — has fully solved this yet.
